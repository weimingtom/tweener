This lists all changes made to Tweener, from newer to older.

This is a manually edited file and not generated by SVN commits. If you want a real commit log in RSS format, [click here](http://subtlety.errtheblog.com/O_o/101.xml).

Minor version numbers are increased on fixes or small changes. Medium version numbers are increased when significant new functionality is added, like a new method or function. The dates used are the dates the feature actually made it to the main project code, not the day they were started or finished, so some features may look like they were all made on the same day even if they took weeks to be done.

Please notice the items marked as **!IMPORTANT!** because they may break compatibility with previous versions of the classes.

**09 jun 09**
  * 1.33.74 - **!IMPORTANT!** CHANGED: added static property `autoOverwrite`, which determines the default value for the `overwrite` parameter; as a reverse of 1.32.74, the default value of `autoOverwrite` is true (Zeh Fernando)

**18 may 09**
  * 1.32.74 - **!IMPORTANT!** CHANGED: made tween overwrite (when adding new tweens) optional; added the `overwrite` parameter; removed the hidden quickAdd parameter from the AS2 version (Zeh Fernando)

**05 oct 08**

  * 1.31.73 - FIXED/CHANGED: removeTweens() now understand special property splitters (like "`_color`"), thanks to Francis Turmel (Zeh Fernando)
    * Also, now adding a SWC (AS3) format to the released versions, thanks to Jason Horwitz ([issue #37](https://code.google.com/p/tweener/issues/detail?id=#37)) (Zeh Fernando)

**05 sep 08**

**21 oct 07**
  * 1.31.67 - FIXED (hotfix): "Special Property Splitters" couldn't split into other "Special Property Splitters", so using the `_filter` splitter with some kinds of filters didn't work; now they spontaneously split into other splitters where splitting is due (Zeh Fernando)
    * FIXED: Special Properties: ColorShortcuts: `_tintBrightness` didn't work well when tweening from negative values (Zeh Fernando)
    * FIXED: Special Properties: ColorShortcuts: `_hue` didn't work well when tweening from negative values (Zeh Fernando)

  * 1.31.66 - ADDED: scope parameter for events: onStartScope, onUpdateScope, onCompleteScope, onOverwriteScope, onErrorScope (Zeh Fernando)
  * 1.30.66 - **!IMPORTANT!** CHANGED: special property classes split into different classes. Many new special properties added: all filters (now using capitalized class name), text effects, special colorization. They're outside of the main package so they're not part of Tweener itself and won't load by default (Zeh Fernando)

  * 1.28.65 - ADDED: transitionParams parameter, for transitions that allow for some customization (Zeh Fernando)
  * 1.27.65 - ADDED: When tweening something that doesn't resolve to an existing property nor a registered special property, outputs an error message (Zeh Fernando)
  * 1.27.64 - CHANGED: Consistency on addCaller and addTween parameters. Forced to two: object or array, then tweening parameters (Zeh Fernando)
  * 1.27.63 - CHANGED: Tweening/Property info object cleanup; removed auxProperties; added isSpecialProperty for speed; additional .extra parameter; .originalValueComplete and .arrayIndex for more complex native tweenings in the future; getProperty/setProperty removed; other internal speed improvements (Zeh Fernando)
  * 1.27.62 - CHANGED: No special properties are automatically registered by default. SpecialPropertiesDefault removed; moved to path `caurina.transitions.properties.*` (Zeh Fernando)

**01 sep 07**

  * 1.20.34 - CHANGED: several speed optimizations for faster Tween addition and execution, specially on the AS2 version (Zeh Fernando)

**27 feb 07**
  * 1.20.33 - (AS3) FIXED: the special tweenings for sound (`_sound_volume` and `_sound_pan`) now actually work. They're not related to a Sound instance, however, but to a SoundChannel instance, since AS3 treats Sound in a very different way (Zeh Fernando)

**27 jan 07**
  * 1.18.27 - FIXED: calling code that executed removeTweens() on the onStart/onUpdate/onComplete events could screw the tweening list and potentially cause the loss of some tweenings; made "safe" removals instead, and focused all actual tweening list removals on updateTweens() (Zeh Fernando)

**03 jan 07**
  * 1.18.26 - (AS3) FIXED: special `_`color properties now work on the AS3 version as well (Zeh Fernando)
