# Credits #

Tweener was built and is maintained by a core group, with the help of several different people. Here's a listing of them.

## Core team ##

  * **[Zeh Fernando](http://labs.zeh.com.br)** created the original Tweener version and still maintains the core code tightly secured under his mattress.

  * **[Nate Chatellier](http://natejc.com/blog/)** ported the original AS2 code to AS3 beginning at version 1.14.17 or so. Versions today are updated in sync, and Nate contributes with bug reports, fixes, and suggestions.

  * **[Arthur Debert](http://www.stimuli.com.br/)** contributed with many ideas, bug reports and fixes, as well as AS3 guidance on porting issues.


## Other versions ##

  * **[Baluta Cristian](http://www.ralcr.com/)** has ported and maintains a [haXe version](http://www.ralcr.com/caurina/) of Tweener.

  * **[Yuichi Tateno](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/secondlife/20070923/1190482393)** (aka secondlife) has ported and maintains a [JavaScript version](http://coderepos.org/share/wiki/JSTweener) of Tweener.

  * **Benjamin Harling** created the [Python version](http://wiki.python-ogre.org/index.php/CodeSnippits_pyTweener) of Tweener.

  * **[Wesley Marques](http://codevein.com/)** maintains a [C++ version](http://code.google.com/p/cpptweener/) of Tweener.


## Translation contributors ##

  * **[Celina Uemura](http://www.cezinha.com.br)** has translated the documentation to [Brazilian Portuguese](http://flashmasters.net/forum/index.php?topic=45519.0).

  * **Ayu Tada** maintains the [Japanese version of the documentation](http://www.tonpoo.com/tweener/).


## Example file contributors ##

  * **[Igor Costa](http://www.igorcosta.org)** contributed with Flex examples.


## Indirect code contributors ##

Tweener uses parts of code written by other people (read more about it on the [License page](http://code.google.com/p/tweener/wiki/License)). People listed here do not necessarily endorse Tweener; it just means we used code created by them.

  * **[Robert Penner](http://www.robertpenner.com/)** is the one who created the original easing equations. Without him Tweener probably wouldn't exist. He also created the optimized pointOnCurve algorithm used on the bezier point calculations.

  * **[Mario Klingemann](http://www.quasimondo.com/)** (also known as Quasimondo) wrote [a great class](http://www.quasimondo.com/archives/000565.php) to manipulate the object color matrix in ActionScript. Parts of his class are used on Tweener to create the special color transitions.


## Suggestions and other thanks ##

These people do not necessarily endorse Tweener either, but they have contributed to the project in one way or the other so here's some acknowledgment. Thanks!

  * **Paulo Afonso** suggested ideas that led to the creation of the [addCaller](addCaller.md) method.

  * **[Francis Turmel](http://www.nectere.ca/)** provided some great suggestions and a lot of inspiration driven from during long emails discussions, as well as several code fixes and suggestions.

  * Also thanks on bug and issue reporting, suggestions for **gvanvreckem**, **[Mathew Ray](http://www.seriphdesign.com/mathew/)**, **[Stacey Mulcahy](http://www.bitchwhocodes.com/)**, **carotids**, **ben.clinkinbeard**, **simen.brekken**, **buginajar**, **DerDanilo**, **[Jason M Horwitz / sekati](http://www.sekati.com/)**, **rolekgrzegorz** and **bodyvisual**.
